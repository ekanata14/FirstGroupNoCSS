                <h4>General</h4>
                <p>A tense is any of the forms of a verb that may be used to show the time of action or state expressed by the verb. Meanwhile the simple present tense is used to express something permanent or habitual. </p>
                <h4>Elementary Level</h4>
                <p>In a proper English sentence you must have subject – predicate – object, with the exceptional of the imperative sentence (kalimat perintah) which has no subject. For example ; Sit down!, Go away!</p>
                <p>In a sentence, whereas the predicate is not a verb, the predicate may be in the form of auxiliary verbs, hence the sentences will go as follows ; </p>
                <div class="image"><img src="Images/table_1.png" alt="Gambar_1"></div>
                <p>How to put the sentence into question :  is by putting the predicate in front of the subject, as follows :</p>
                <div class="image"><img src="Images/table_1-1.png" alt="Gambar_1-1"></div>
                <p>When you use a verb as a predicate and you have a third singular person as the subject of the sentence, add “s” to the verb, for example :</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>1. I work in Denpasar</li>
                    <li>2. You work in Singaraja<li>
                    <li>3. They work in Singaraja</li>
                    <li>4. We work in Singaraja</li>
                </ol>
                <p>But: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>1. Ken Jaya works in the hospital</li>
                    <li>2. Ken Ayu works in the bank<li>
                    <li>3. It works very wel</li>
                    <li>4. We work in Singaraja</li>
                </ol>
                <p>To form a negative sentence is by adding the word not to the auxiliary verb do. For example :</p>
                <div class="image">

                    <img src="Images/not_2.png" alt="Gambar_1-1">
                </div>
                <p>The introgative sentence is formed by putting the auxiliary verb in front of the subject, as follows :</p>
                <div class="image">

            <div class="content continous">
                <h3 id="continous-tense">Continous Tense</h3>
                <p><strong>The continuos tense</strong> shows an action that is, was, or will be in progress at a certain time. The continuous tense is formed with the verb ‘be’ + -ing form of the verb.</p>
                <p><strong>The present continuos</strong> can be used to show an action which is happening at the time of the speaking.      Example : I am having dinner at the moment.</p>
                <p><strong>The Past continuos</strong> can be used to show an action which was happening in the past. It is important to remember that the Past continuous is usually used to show an action which was happening when another action, which is usually shorter, happened at the same time, stopped the continuous action or started after the continuous action.</p>
                <p>Example :</p>
                <p>I was having dinner when Sarah called me.</p>
                <p>I was walking along the beach when it started raining.</p>
                <p><strong>The future continuos</strong> is used to show that an action will be happening at a time in the future.</p>
                <p>Example: I will be having dinner at my parents house tomorrow.</p>

The former is by adding ed to the end of the infinitive form of the verbs while for the irregular verbs you have to memorize them. ( see list of the irregular verbs.
